# JS_Libraries_practice
Practicing with and creating npm packages and libraries.

You can check these out in your own applications using https://www.npmjs.com/package/@makemesenpai/stringlib, https://www.npmjs.com/package/@makemesenpai/dateLib, and https://www.npmjs.com/package/@makemesenpai/apilib
but this is mainly used as a reference. I wonder if I can connect this to github packages tho.
